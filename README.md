# metronome-app
A mobile friendly metronome web app built using the Web Audio API, React, Redux, and Web Workers.

I originally started developing this so that I could have a metronome app with good UI/UX design available on my mobile device, but was unable to get the Web Audio API to work on mobile Safari with iOS11. As such this project is for now shelved :(

Code borrowed from @scottwhudson's [metronome](https://github.com/cwilso/metronome) which borrowed code from @cwilson's [metronome](https://github.com/cwilso/metronome).
